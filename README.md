# MariaDB ColumnStore API

The API requires MariaDB ColumnStore 1.1 to operate.

This C++, Python and Java API currently provides access to bulk write to ColumnStore in a similar way to the cpimport using.

## Bugs

Please file bugs using the [MariaDB ColumnStore Jira](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MCOL) 

## Build Dependencies

**NOTE**
CentOS 6 is not currently supported and it is not expected that the API will build on this platform.

### Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial)

For the main build you need:

```shell
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libuv1-dev libxml2-dev libsnappy-dev pkg-config swig python-dev default-jdk
```

For the documentation:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-sphinx texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra latexmk
```

For test test suite:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev cppcheck
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
sudo make
sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/
```
### Debian 8 (Jessie)

Debian Jessie will only compile if the latest CLang is along with LLVM's libc++, it also requires packages that are not in the main repositories. First of all you need Debian's Jessie backports repository enabled, edit the file `/etc/apt/sources.list` and add the following line:

```
deb http://httpredir.debian.org/debian jessie-backports main contrib non-free
```

Then install the following:

```shell
sudo apt-get install cmake g++ libuv1-dev libxml2-dev libsnappy-dev pkg-config clang-3.8 libc++-dev swig python-dev default-jdk
```

Now set the following environment variables so that CLang is used to compile:

```shell
export CC=clang-3.8
export CXX=clang++-3.8
export CXXFLAGS=-stdlib=libc++
```

For the documentation:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python-sphinx texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra latexmk python-pip
sudo pip install python-sphinx
```

For the test suite make sure you still have the exported environment variables above and then do the following in a directory separate from the API:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest
cd googletest
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
make
sudo make install
```

### CentOS 7

For the main build you need the following, the devtoolset is because GCC5 minimum is required for full C++11 support:

```shell
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install cmake libuv-devel libxml2-devel snappy-devel
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install devtoolset-4-gcc*
sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel swig python-devel
scl enable devtoolset-4 bash
```

For the documentation:

```shell
sudo yum install python-sphinx texlive-scheme-full latexmk
```

For the test suite:

```shell
sudo yum install gtest-devel cppcheck
```

### SUSE Enterprise Linux 12

For the main build you need GCC5 minimum. For this example we are using GCC6, you will need the SDK and Toolchain modules enabled in Yast first:

```shell
sudo zypper install gcc6 gcc6-c++ cmake libxml2-devel snappy-devel git

export CC=/usr/bin/gcc-6
export CXX=/usr/bin/g++-6
```

Then in a directory separate from the API:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/libuv/libuv
cd libuv
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```

Unfortunately it is not possible to build the documentation in SUSE Enterprise Linux 12 due to missing LaTeX dependencies.

For the test suite do the following in a directory separate from the API:

```shell
sudo zypper ar -f http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/tools/SLE_12_SP3/devel:tools.repo
sudo zypper install cppcheck
git clone https://github.com/google/googletest
cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
make
sudo make install
```

### CMake Options

Several options are available when execution CMake by using the following
command line:

```shell
cmake -D<Variable>=<Value>
```

Alternatively you can use one of the CMake GUIs to set the options.

The options are as follows:

| Option | Default | Definition |
| ------ | ------ | ---------- |
| ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` | (Platform dependent) | Where to install libmcsapi |
| ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` | ``RELWITHDEBINFO`` | The type of build (``Debug``, ``Release`` or ``RelWithDebInfo``) |
| ``TEST_RUNNER`` | ``OFF`` | Build the test suite |
| ``BUILD_DOCS`` | ``OFF`` | Build the PDF documentation |
| ``RPM`` | ``OFF`` | Build a RPM (and the OS name for the package) |
| ``DEB`` | ``OFF`` | Build a DEB (and the OS name for the package) |
| ``PYTHON`` | ``ON`` | Build the Python library |
| ``JAVA`` | ``ON`` | Build the Java library |
| ``RUN_CPPCHECK`` | ``OFF`` | Run cppcheck during ``make test`` or ``make all_cppcheck``|

### Compiling

After running CMake as described above you simple need to run ``make`` and then ``sudo make install``.
To run the test suite you can run ``make check``.

## Building a Package

To build an RPM or DEB package you first need to specify the OS you want to build for, for example:

```shell
cmake . -DRPM=centos7
```

```shell
cmake . -DDEB=xenial
```

You should of course add options as above to this as required. Then you can build the package using:

```shell
make package
```
